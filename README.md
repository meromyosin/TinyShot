### TinyShot
Simple one click screenshots

## How To  
You will need to install it first. So grab the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/meromyosin/TinyShot/releases). Its a simple setup.  
At the exit dialog make sure to tick checkbox for Run. Or if u didn't then just run tinyshot from Start Menu>TinyShot.

You will find the exe running down in system tray.(It maybe hidden under expand arrow). One Right Click and you have taken a screenshot.

All of your screenshots will be saved in Pictures/TS folder  
The screenshots are saved as png for better quality. The name scheme is also very simple and easy to understand.

## Why I made this tool?  
WINDOWS SUCKS. I couldn't find a simple app, which just takes screenshots by one click. Almost every program has 2,3 click process. Keyboard shortcut Win+PrtSc is good, but the filename is Screenshot(1), Screenshot(2), and so on. I hate this awfull name scheme. On laptops you have to press Fn key too, that's another hassle. And don't get me started on Snip&Sketch. You have to name each screenshot, manually save it, wtf is wrong with MS????
